Perhaps you just happened to come across it in your travels.$(br2)Regardless of the means of acquisition, I welcome you, to the wonderful world of $(thing)Alchemical Artisanship$(). Not to be confused with $(thing)Alchemy$(), mind you. This is a different beast altogether, and deserves just as much respect."

Perhaps you may have just taken me for a pedantic writer who pays undue attention to terminology.$(br2)Regardless, the difference is simple. $(thing)Alchemy$() is the art of transforming matter. $(thing)Alchemical Artisanship$(), however, is the art of harnessing matter's properties to fuel one's ingenuity and creative drive."

The four commonly accepted pillars of the art are as follows:$(li)Ritualism;$(li)Engineering;$(li)Artificing;$(li)Spell Writing;$(br2)The $(item)Lexica Alquimia$() will go through all of these in detail, after a few chapters of introductory information to initiate newcomers to the field."

It's been a long journey, and you made me able to get through it.$(br2)Last but not least, you, the reader, player of mods. This book would not exist without your devotion, and you are to be thanked for that as well. I hope you enjoy it."
